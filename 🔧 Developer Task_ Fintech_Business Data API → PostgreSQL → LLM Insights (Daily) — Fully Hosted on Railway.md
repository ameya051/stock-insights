### **🔧 Developer Task: Fintech/Business Data API → PostgreSQL → LLM Insights (Daily) — Fully Hosted on Railway**

---

### **🎯 Objective**

Build a daily automated pipeline that:

1. Fetches business performance or fintech-related data from a third-party API (e.g., **Plaid**, **Clearbit**, or another API that provides ready-made performance data).

2. Stores the data in PostgreSQL.

3. Sends the latest data to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI) for insights and performance recommendations.

4. Runs automatically once per day.

5. Is fully hosted on [Railway.app](https://railway.app/).

6. Develop an user interface to show the data 

---

### **🔌 Example Data Sources (Choose one with rich, accessible API metrics):**

* **Plaid** – transaction and spending behavior

* **Clearbit** – traffic, firmographics, intent

* **OpenBB** – financial and market data

* **Any API that offers daily KPIs with a developer-accessible plan**

💡 Choose a source with daily or near-daily data updates and public API documentation with simple auth (e.g., API key, OAuth).

---

### **📊 Metrics to Fetch**

Pull performance data such as:

* Traffic or channel breakdown

* Customer acquisition metrics

* Engagement KPIs (bounce rate, time on site)

* Financial indicators (e.g., spend, revenue, transactions)

Dimensions & metrics depend on the chosen API.

---

### **🗄️ Data Storage (PostgreSQL)**

Use Railway’s hosted PostgreSQL instance. Store raw API response in a normalized schema with daily timestamping.

---

### **🤖 LLM Analysis**

Use **OpenAI GPT-4** or similar LLMs via **OpenRouter**, **Ollama**, or other provider.

**Steps:**

* Query the most recent (yesterday's) data

* Send it to the LLM with a structured prompt like:

"You are a fintech analyst. Based on the following performance data for \[YYYY-MM-DD\], provide a short summary and 3 actionable recommendations to improve performance. Data:\\n\\n\[insert relevant KPIs and breakdowns\]"

* Store the output in a daily\_recommendations table in PostgreSQL.

---

### **⏰ Scheduled Job**

Configure a daily cron job (via Railway’s scheduler or a hosted script) that:

1. Pulls data from the selected API

2. Inserts into Postgres

3. Queries the latest day's metrics

4. Sends to the LLM

5. Stores LLM recommendations

---

### **🚀 Hosting on Railway**

Deploy the entire project (ETL \+ LLM integration) on **Railway**. Use Railway's PostgreSQL, scheduler, and deployment system.

---

### **✅ Deliverables**

* Working hosted pipeline on Railway

* UI with the analysis and graph

* Code with comments and documentation

### **🗨️ Comments**

If you face issues with API limits, data schema, or LLM prompting, let me know so we can adapt.

---

Let me know if you want a version with a specific API (e.g. SimilarWeb or Plaid), and I can tailor the data fetching and prompt logic.
